My nickname is Graph. I've been a software engineer for 3 years.

I'm being passionate chess. So I created an open source project called [Makruk JS](https://github.com/kaisukez/makruk-js), it's a Makruk (Thai chess) library written in Typescript.

Lately I study Go language for fun in Leetcode and my private toy project.
